# agentic-rag

> Autonomous RAG where the AI agent controls retrieval — decides when to search, which sources to query, iterates on results, and synthesizes across multiple knowledge bases with citations.

## Overview

This plugin bundles **5 primitives** (1 agents, 1 instructions, 0 skills, 3 hooks) into a single installable package. All primitives are WAF-aligned and compatible with the FAI Protocol auto-wiring system.

## Installation

```bash
npx frootai install agentic-rag
```

Or manually copy the referenced primitives from the FrootAI repository into your project.

## What's Included

| Type | Name | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| Agent | `agentic-rag` | Agentic rag specialist |
| Instruction | `python-waf` | Python waf standards |
| Hook | `frootai-secrets-scanner` | Secrets scanner gate |
| Hook | `frootai-tool-guardian` | Tool guardian gate |
| Hook | `frootai-governance-audit` | Governance audit gate |

## Compatible Solution Plays

- **Play 21-agentic-rag**

## Keywords

`agentic-rag` `autonomous-retrieval` `multi-source` `azure-ai-search` `openai` `evaluated`

## Usage

After installation, the primitives are available in your project:

1. **Agents** activate when you `@mention` them in Copilot Chat
2. **Instructions** auto-apply to matching files via `applyTo` glob patterns
3. **Skills** are invoked by agents or via `/skill` commands
4. **Hooks** fire automatically at session lifecycle events

When used inside a solution play with `fai-manifest.json`, all primitives auto-wire through the FAI Protocol — shared context, WAF guardrails, and evaluation thresholds propagate automatically.

## WAF Alignment

| Pillar | Coverage |
|--------|----------|
| Security | Secrets scanning, Managed Identity, Key Vault integration, RBAC |
| Reliability | Retry with backoff, circuit breaker, health probes, fallback chains |
| Operational Excellence | CI/CD integration, observability, IaC templates, automated testing |

## Quality Gates

When used inside a play, this plugin enforces:

| Metric | Threshold |
|--------|-----------|
| Groundedness | ≥ 0.85 |
| Coherence | ≥ 0.80 |
| Relevance | ≥ 0.80 |
| Safety | 0 violations |
| Cost per query | ≤ $0.05 |
